2. # Tesla and GameStop Revenue Dashboard Project  (Graphs aren't visible for some reason)

      ## Overview  
      This project is part of an advanced data science curriculum to demonstrate the practical application of data extraction, analysis, and visualization techniques. As a data scientist working for an investment firm, you are tasked with creating an interactive dashboard to compare the stock prices of **Tesla** and **GameStop** against their revenue. This project integrates skills learned in previous labs, including **YFinance** for financial data retrieval and **web scraping** to obtain       
      revenue data.  
      
      ## Project Objectives  
      - **Data Extraction**: Use the YFinance library to gather historical stock price data for Tesla and GameStop.  
      - **Web Scraping**: Extract revenue data for both companies from relevant financial reports or websites.  
      - **Data Visualization**: Build a comprehensive dashboard to visualize and compare stock prices and revenue trends over time.  
      - **Peer Review**: Evaluate a peer's submission and provide constructive feedback, as part of the grading process.  
      
      ## Key Features  
      1. **Stock Price Analysis**:  
         - Retrieve and plot historical stock price data for Tesla and GameStop using the YFinance API.  
         - Ensure the data is cleaned and processed for accurate visualization.  
      
      2. **Revenue Data Extraction**:  
         - Implement web scraping techniques to gather revenue data from reliable financial websites.  
         - Clean and format the data for analysis and visualization.  
      
      3. **Dashboard Creation**:  
         - Build an interactive dashboard using tools such as Matplotlib, Plotly, or Dash.  
         - Compare trends in stock prices and revenue for Tesla and GameStop side by side.  
      
      4. **Submission and Peer Review**:  
         - Upload screenshots of your code and results to document your work.  
         - Review and grade a peer's submission as part of a collaborative learning experience.  
      
      ## Prerequisites  
      Before starting this project, ensure you have completed the following:  
      - **YFinance Lab**: Learn how to extract stock price data programmatically.  
      - **Web Scraping Lab**: Gain experience in extracting and processing data from web pages.  
      
      ## Deliverables  
      1. **Codebase**: A Python script that includes:  
         - Data extraction using YFinance.  
         - Revenue data scraping.  
         - Dashboard creation.  
      2. **Screenshots**: Upload screenshots of your working code and resulting visualizations.  
      3. **Dashboard**: A fully functional dashboard comparing Tesla and GameStop stock prices vs revenue.  
      4. **Peer Review**: Constructive feedback on one peer's project submission.  
      
      ## Tools and Libraries  
      - **YFinance**: To gather stock price data.  
      - **BeautifulSoup/Selenium**: For web scraping revenue data.  
      - **Matplotlib/Plotly/Dash**: For data visualization and dashboard development.  
      
      ## Learning Outcomes  
      - Apply financial data extraction and web scraping skills in a real-world context.  
      - Build an end-to-end data analysis and visualization solution.  
      - Enhance collaborative skills through peer review and feedback.
